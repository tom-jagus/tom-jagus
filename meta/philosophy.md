# 🧭 Mission, Vision & Values

## 🎯 Mission

I get the most satisfaction from helping people make sense of complexity — whether it's a messy dataset, a broken reporting process, or an unclear business question.

My mission is to solve problems that actually matter. I build tools and systems that reduce friction, reveal insight, and give people the confidence to make smart decisions. That might look like a Power BI model, a set of scripts, a process fix, or a conversation that uncovers what’s really going wrong.

I do this work because I like seeing things click. I like watching someone use a tool I’ve built and say, “Ah — now I get it.” If I can help bring clarity where there was confusion, or momentum where there was stagnation, then I’ve done what I set out to do.
