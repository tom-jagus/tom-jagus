# 👤 About Me

## 🧭 Who I Am

I'm Tom Jagus — a solution provider, problem solver, and value enabler with a deep focus on data, automation, and business impact. I work as a self-employed consultant helping organizations of all sizes make sense of their data, streamline processes, and build tools that drive better decisions.

I’m driven by the challenge of understanding complex problems and designing clean, scalable solutions that people actually use. Whether I’m working solo or embedded in a cross-functional team, I aim to bring structure, empathy, and forward momentum to every project.

I believe that good tooling, clear data, and thoughtful automation don’t just improve processes — they enable better decisions and a healthier work culture.

## 🧰 What I Do

I help organizations extract, transform, analyze, and act on data — whether it lives in APIs, spreadsheets, databases, or modern cloud platforms. My work spans the entire data lifecycle, from automation of raw data collection to interactive dashboards that enable real-time decision making.

I build reliable pipelines for gathering and shaping data, design models to surface insights, and develop reports and analytical tools that tell clear, accurate stories. Whether I’m working on large-scale enterprise systems or helping teams get quick answers from small, messy datasets, I aim to make data useful, accessible, and aligned with business goals.

Alongside the technical work, I frequently mentor teams, document systems, improve internal processes, and guide organizations toward scalable, maintainable solutions that grow with their needs.

## 🧠 How I Work

I typically work on a long-term contract basis, but I’m equally comfortable delivering high-impact results on shorter freelance or project-based engagements. I adapt easily to the needs of each organization — whether that means working autonomously, integrating into a larger team, or bridging gaps between departments.

I thrive in environments that value iteration, adaptability, and trust. While I prefer agile principles and feedback-driven development, I’m used to applying them within more traditional or rigid workflows — especially in large enterprise environments.

At the core of my process is clear communication, documentation, and a strong bias toward action. I believe that building momentum and removing ambiguity early creates space for smarter decisions later.

## 💡 What Sets Me Apart

I don't just write scripts or build dashboards — I focus on solving the real problem behind the request. My goal in every project is to understand the context, define the right solution, and deliver tools that actually enable better decisions.

I approach each challenge by thinking about long-term impact and business value. That often means simplifying workflows, improving visibility, and giving teams access to insights they didn’t know they needed.

I also care deeply about maintainability. I build solutions that are not only effective today, but clear and adaptable tomorrow — whether I’m maintaining them or someone else is picking them up later.

## 📈 Tools & Technologies I Use

My day-to-day toolkit includes a mix of languages, platforms, and power tools that let me move quickly from raw data to insight to delivery.

Some of the tools I use most include:

- **Power BI** and **Microsoft Fabric** for end-to-end data modeling and reporting
- **Power Query**, **DAX**, and **TMDL** for powerful data transformations and semantic modeling
- **Python** and **SQL** for scripting, automation, analysis, and integration
- **Tabular Editor**, **DAX Studio**, and **Excel** for modeling, debugging, and data validation
- **Git**, **Neovim**, and terminal-based workflows for versioned, automated, and repeatable development
- **LLMs** and **prompt engineering** for accelerating insight discovery, automation, and interface design
- **Generative AI tools** for building enhanced user experiences, intelligent content generation, and design acceleration
- **Machine learning workflows** for deeper pattern recognition and predictive analysis

My environment is built to be lean, portable, and fast — whether I’m deploying to enterprise BI platforms or automating a data pipeline with a shell script.

## 🧪 What I Specialize In

My core expertise lies in solving data-driven problems at the intersection of business logic, automation, and usability. I specialize in:

- Designing and optimizing **data models and reporting systems** that align with real decision-making needs
- Automating **data extraction, transformation, and integration workflows**, across APIs, Excel files, and structured platforms
- Building **Power BI solutions** that scale across organizations while remaining performant and maintainable
- Applying **Power Query (M)** and **DAX** to create flexible, dynamic, and logic-rich analytics layers
- Crafting **LLM-based workflows and prompt systems** that augment productivity, automate insight generation, and surface deeper context
- Leveraging **Python** and **TMDL** for large-scale, repeatable modeling, scripting, and semantic management
- Documenting, optimizing, and mentoring around **data workflows**, **governance**, and **cross-team knowledge transfer**

I’m also actively expanding my work into **machine learning**, with a focus on integrating predictive insights into real-world business flows — not just building models, but helping users understand and act on them.

## 🧬 My Roles & Career Journey

My professional path started in visual and front-end design, but quickly evolved toward systems thinking, data, and tooling. Over the years, I’ve taken on roles that blend creativity, structure, and problem-solving — and those experiences continue to shape how I approach every challenge.

I’ve worked as a:

- 🎨 **Graphic Designer** and **Front-End Developer**, where I learned the value of clean communication, usability, and user-centered thinking
- 🛠️ **Support Specialist**, helping users troubleshoot real problems and build empathy for those on the other side of the system
- 📊 **Data Analyst** and **BI Expert**, where I began designing models, building reports, and turning raw data into actionable insight
- 📈 **Reporting Analyst** and **Continual Improvement Manager**, leading process optimization efforts, documentation standards, and business-wide reporting strategies
- 🧩 **IT Tools Consultant**, where I now work across systems, teams, and platforms to deliver automation, architecture, and scalable solutions

I’ve spent the last decade supporting multimillion-dollar organizations across industries including **Service Management**, **IT Support**, **SLA Monitoring**, **Talent Deployment**, and **Change Enablement** — always with a focus on enabling smarter decisions, more efficient processes, and better use of data.

## 📌 Core Principles

These are the principles I bring to every project, no matter the scale, tools, or domain:

- **Understand the problem before proposing the solution**  
  Great tools are meaningless if they solve the wrong thing. I start with context.

- **Build solutions that enable value, not complexity**  
  The best systems are the ones people can understand, trust, and act on.

- **Document and communicate with intention**  
  Good documentation reduces confusion, scales impact, and respects others’ time.

- **Solve once, reuse often**  
  If I’ve done it twice, I automate it, templatize it, or build it into my workflow.

- **Bias toward clarity, adaptability, and ownership**  
  I design systems to be picked up, extended, and debugged by someone else — including future me.

- **Make decisions with the business in mind**  
  I don’t build for technical elegance alone — I build to support decision-making, growth, and change.
