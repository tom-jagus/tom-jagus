# 👋 Hi, I’m Tom Jagus

I'm a data-focused consultant and developer who helps solve real problems through clear structure, automation, and well-designed systems.

I specialize in building tools and workflows that reduce friction, unlock insight, and support better decision-making — whether that's through data modeling, scripting, or AI integration.

## 🧰 What I Work On

My work spans several domains, but it always comes back to structure, clarity, and meaningful outcomes. I focus on:

- **Data modeling & reporting** — building semantic models, metrics, and reports in Power BI and Microsoft Fabric
- **Automation & scripting** — streamlining workflows with Python, APIs, shell scripts, and cross-platform tooling
- **LLMs & AI integration** — using prompt engineering, embeddings, and local tools to augment analysis and decision-making
- **Process optimization** — improving systems, reducing manual effort, and documenting the things that matter

## 🔍 How I Work

I approach problems with a mix of structure, curiosity, and long-term thinking. Whether I’m working solo or inside a team, I aim for:

- **Clarity first** — understanding the real problem before jumping into tools or code
- **Sustainable solutions** — building systems that are simple to use, easy to maintain, and valuable over time
- **Documented decisions** — making context visible through commit history, markdown notes, and readable configuration
- **Small, confident steps** — shipping iteratively and refining as feedback or clarity improves
