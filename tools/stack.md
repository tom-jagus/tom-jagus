# 🧰 My Working Stack

## 🖥️ Programming & Query Languages

These are the core languages I use to build, automate, and model solutions — from semantic layers to scripting to interface design.

- **Python** — scripting, automation, data analysis, scraping, and integration
- **SQL** — querying, transformation, and modeling across BI and backend systems
- **DAX** — advanced measure creation and expression logic for Power BI models
- **Power Query (M)** — data transformation and shaping inside Power BI
- **TMDL** — semantic modeling and deployment for enterprise-scale tabular models
- **Lua** — daily use for customizing and extending my Neovim configuration (via LazyVim)
- **C#** — scripting in Tabular Editor for DAX automation and metadata handling
- **JavaScript** — used for scripting in workflow automation and custom widgets
- **HTML/CSS** — used for styling and customizing visual elements in web-based reports and dashboards
