# ðŸš€ Releases

This document defines how releases are managed across repositories. It provides a consistent approach to versioning, tagging, and publishing meaningful changes â€” whether the repository contains config files, automation scripts, personal tools, or documented standards.

Releases help ensure that important milestones are:

- Easy to trace and reproduce
- Properly versioned
- Documented for future reference
