# ðŸš€ Releases

This document defines how releases are managed across repositories. It provides a consistent approach to versioning, tagging, and publishing meaningful changes â€” whether the repository contains config files, automation scripts, personal tools, or documented standards.

Releases help ensure that important milestones are:

- Easy to trace and reproduce
- Properly versioned
- Documented for future reference

## ðŸ“¦ What Counts as a Release

A release marks a meaningful, traceable point in the evolution of a repository. Not every merged change needs a release â€” only those that represent a completed unit of progress or introduce notable change.

Releases are typically created when:

- A new feature is added or major capability is completed
- A large configuration or structure change is introduced
- Breaking changes are made that affect usability or compatibility
- A tool, config, or workflow is considered stable enough to reuse
- A milestone is reached (e.g., MVP ready, full migration complete)

Routine updates (e.g., typos, minor formatting, non-functional tweaks) do not require tagging unless theyâ€™re part of a larger bundled change.
