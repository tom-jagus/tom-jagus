# üöÄ Releases

This document defines how releases are managed across repositories. It provides a consistent approach to versioning, tagging, and publishing meaningful changes ‚Äî whether the repository contains config files, automation scripts, personal tools, or documented standards.

Releases help ensure that important milestones are:

- Easy to trace and reproduce
- Properly versioned
- Documented for future reference

## üì¶ What Counts as a Release

A release marks a meaningful, traceable point in the evolution of a repository. Not every merged change needs a release ‚Äî only those that represent a completed unit of progress or introduce notable change.

Releases are typically created when:

- A new feature is added or major capability is completed
- A large configuration or structure change is introduced
- Breaking changes are made that affect usability or compatibility
- A tool, config, or workflow is considered stable enough to reuse
- A milestone is reached (e.g., MVP ready, full migration complete)

Routine updates (e.g., typos, minor formatting, non-functional tweaks) do not require tagging unless they‚Äôre part of a larger bundled change.

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning Strategy

All releases follow a simple semantic versioning format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

Example: `0.3.1`

This format is used to communicate the scope of change and expected impact.

### Version bump rules

- `MAJOR` (`1.0.0` ‚Üí `2.0.0`)  
  Reserved for major redesigns, full rewrites, or backward-incompatible changes.

- `MINOR` (`0.4.0` ‚Üí `0.5.0`)  
  Used for feature additions, plugin group expansions, or completed functional milestones.

- `PATCH` (`0.4.2` ‚Üí `0.4.3`)  
  Used for small fixes, polish, or non-breaking improvements.

### Versioning scope

The same versioning format is applied across:

| Repo Type           | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Config repos        | Bump when structure changes, tools are added, or setup flow is improved        |
| Script/tool repos   | Bump when functionality changes, flags are added, or compatibility is extended |
| Documentation repos | Optional ‚Äî tag only at major rewrites or clean base snapshots                  |
